Description: fast, scalable and extensible HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.0 caching proxy server
 This package provides the Apache Traffic Server, a fast, scalable reverse
 proxy server which may operate as forward proxy as well. Apache Traffic Server
 supports:
 .
   * Caching: improve response time while reducing server load and bandwidth
     needs by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages, images, and
     web service calls.
   * Proxying: add keep-alive, filter or anonymize content requests, or add
     load balancing by adding a proxy layer.
   * Scaling: handle 10s of thousands of requests per second on modern SMP
     hardware.
   * Extensions: use the API to do anything from modifying HTTP headers to
     handling ESI requests to writing your own cache algorithm.
