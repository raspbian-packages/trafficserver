    8.1.x: Reject Transfer-Encoding in pre-HTTP/1.1 requests (#8457)
    
    Per spec, Transfer-Encoding is only supported in HTTP/1.1. For earlier
    versions, we must reject Transfer-Encoding rather than interpret it
    since downstream proxies may ignore the chunk header and rely upon the
    Content-Length, or interpret the body some other way.  These differences
    in interpretation may open up the door to compatibility issues. To
    protect against this, we reply with a 4xx if the client uses
    Transfer-Encoding with HTTP versions that do not support it.
