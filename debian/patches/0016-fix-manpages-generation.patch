Description: Fix manpages generation
 Default documentation build puts everything in a single file
 which is not convenient for manpages.
 To get separate man pages files, we need to define the
 man_pages variable in conf.py
 Currently, this variable is defined in manpages.py
 but this file is never included into conf.py.
